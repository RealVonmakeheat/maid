Create a simple logo for the Maid CLI tool:

1. Create a minimalist logo that represents cleaning/organizing files
2. Use a broom or cleaning icon with a CLI/terminal theme
3. Color scheme: blue and white, or a light purple theme
4. Save as maid-logo.png in this directory
5. Use a transparent background
6. Make sure it looks good at small sizes (favicon) and larger sizes (website header)

The logo should look professional and match the modern CLI tool aesthetic.
